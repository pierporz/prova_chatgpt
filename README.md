# Auto Clicker

This project includes a simple Python GUI application that automates mouse clicks.
Users can configure the duration (in seconds) and the click frequency (clicks per second).

## Requirements

- Python 3
- [`pyautogui`](https://pypi.org/project/pyautogui/) for performing the mouse clicks.
  Install via `pip install pyautogui`.

## Usage

Run the application with:

```bash
python autoclicker.py
```

The interface provides fields to set the desired duration and frequency.
Press **Start** to begin clicking and **Stop** to halt the process.
